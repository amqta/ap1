# AP1 - Algorithms and Programming I

Welcome to the AP1 repository! This repository contains the C codes developed during the "Algoritmos e Programação I" classes, starting from Lab 05.

This course covers the fundamentals of C programming. The laboratory exercises focus on foundational concepts such as:

* **Basic Syntax & Operators:** Variables, primitive data types (`int`, `float`, `char`, etc.), arithmetic and logical operators, increment/decrement (`++`), ternary operator (`? :`), `sizeof`.
* **Input/Output:** Reading user input (`scanf`) and displaying output (`printf`).
* **Control Flow:**
    * Using conditional statements (`if`, `else`) and `switch`.
    * Implementing loops with `while`, `do-while`, and `for`.
* **Basic Math & Algorithms:** Including calculations with `math.h` (`sqrt`, `pow`), sequence generation (Fibonacci-like), primality tests (basic), factorials, and various arithmetic problems within loops.
* **Arrays (Vectors):** Declaring, initializing, reading input into, accessing, and manipulating one-dimensional arrays. Finding min/max values, calculating averages, reversing arrays, and identifying duplicates. Using `rand()` and `sleep()` with arrays.

Feel free to explore the laboratory exercises (`lab XX/exYY.c`) to see the implementation of these fundamental concepts.
