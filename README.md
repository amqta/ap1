# AP1 - Algorithms and Programming I

Welcome to the AP1 repository! This repository contains the C codes developed during the "Algoritmos e Programação I" classes.

This course covers the fundamentals of C programming. The laboratory exercises focus on foundational concepts such as:

* **Basic Syntax:** Variables, primitive data types (`int`, `float`, `char`, etc.), and operators.
* **Input/Output:** Reading user input (`scanf`) and displaying output (`printf`).
* **Control Flow:** Using conditional statements (`if`, `else`, `switch`) and loops (`for`, `while`, `do-while`) to control program execution.
* **Arrays (Vectors):** Declaring, initializing, accessing, and manipulating one-dimensional arrays.
* **Basic Algorithms & Math:** Implementing solutions involving calculations, sequences (like Fibonacci), primality tests, and using standard math functions (`math.h`).

Feel free to explore the laboratory exercises (`lab XX/exYY.c`) to see the implementation of these fundamental concepts.
